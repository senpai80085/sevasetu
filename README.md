# SevaSetu — AI Trust Infrastructure for Informal Caregivers

## Tagline
**Voice-based verification and trust scoring system that converts unorganized caregivers into digitally trusted healthcare workers.**

---

## Problem (Ground Reality)

India’s home-care ecosystem runs largely on informal labor networks. Families depend on neighbors, word-of-mouth, or brokers to hire caregivers for elderly and post-hospital patients.

### Real Consequences
- No verified skills or certification
- Fake experience claims
- Families fear negligence or abuse
- Skilled workers remain unemployed due to lack of proof
- Migrant children cannot arrange safe care remotely

> This is not a discovery problem.  
> This is a **trust verification problem**.

India has millions of capable caregivers — but zero scalable way to verify competence without formal education or paperwork.

## Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Current Method | Failure |
|------|------|
| Agencies | Exist only in metro cities |
| ID/KYC verification | Proves identity, not skill |
| Ratings | Appear after harm occurs |
| Interviews | Subjective and inconsistent |
| Certification courses | Expensive & inaccessible |

The majority of caregivers cannot prove skills because they are experiential workers, not certified workers.

Therefore traditional apps cannot solve this — they require documents that the workforce does not possess.

---

## Our Core Insight

Caregiving ability can be inferred from **conversation, reasoning, and scenario responses**.

Humans evaluate trust verbally — not through certificates.  
SevaSetu replicates this process using AI.

---

## Solution Overview

SevaSetu is a **voice-first AI capability assessment system** that evaluates caregiver competence through structured spoken interaction and generates a **Trust Passport**.

It transforms an undocumented worker into a digitally verifiable professional.

---

## How It Works (System Flow)

1. Caregiver calls or opens app (no typing required)
2. AI conducts spoken interview in native language
3. Scenario-based questions simulate real care situations
4. Model evaluates reasoning, safety awareness, empathy indicators
5. System generates competency profile + risk score
6. Families hire based on capability instead of claims

---

## Example Evaluation

Instead of asking:

> Do you know how to care for a stroke patient?

System asks:

> If a patient suddenly stops responding while eating, what will you do first?

The answer determines practical knowledge, not memorized theory.

## Key Innovation — AI Trust Engine

### Trust Passport
A portable, tamper-resistant profile containing:

- Skill inference score
- Safety awareness level
- Experience authenticity probability
- Communication clarity rating
- Reliability indicators

This acts as a substitute for certificates in informal sectors.

---

## Bharat-First Design

| Constraint | Implementation |
|------|------|
| Low literacy | Fully voice interface |
| Regional languages | Multilingual speech processing |
| Low internet | Offline-first interview buffering |
| No documents | Capability inference instead of paperwork |
| Trust gap | Behavioral evaluation instead of ratings |
| Low cost phones | Runs on entry-level Android devices |

---

## Why AI Is Necessary

This system requires AI because it performs tasks impossible with rules:

- Interpreting open-ended spoken responses
- Inferring competence from explanation patterns
- Detecting uncertainty and unsafe reasoning
- Differentiating memorized vs experiential answers

> A database cannot evaluate judgment.  
> A form cannot evaluate responsibility.

This is fundamentally a **cognitive assessment problem**.

## Target Users

### Primary
Urban migrant families arranging care remotely for elderly parents in Tier-2/3 towns

### Secondary
Informal caregivers seeking employment without certificates

### Institutional
Hospitals discharging patients needing home monitoring support

---

## Measurable Impact

| Metric | Expected Change |
|------|------|
| Hiring time | 3 days → 20 minutes |
| Wrong hire probability | Significant reduction |
| Worker employability | Increased without training cost |
| Family confidence | Immediate trust before first visit |
| Post-discharge complications | Reduced due to better care matching |

---

## Deployment Model

- Mobile app + phone call interface
- No training required for caregivers
- Works via guided conversation
- Can integrate with hospitals, NGOs, or local governance

**Cost per verification:** minimal (single automated interview)

---

## Societal Impact

SevaSetu creates a new category of digital identity:

> **Skill identity for informal workers**

Potential sectors after caregiving:
- Domestic helpers
- Patient attendants
- Community health workers
- Rural service providers

This converts unorganized labor into trusted workforce infrastructure.

---

## Technology Stack (Prototype)

- Speech Recognition
- Language Understanding Model
- Reasoning Assessment Engine
- Trust Scoring Algorithm
- Multilingual Text-to-Speech
- Lightweight mobile interface

---

## Future Expansion

- Government health worker onboarding
- Insurance validation support
- Hospital discharge integration
- Nationwide informal workforce registry

---

## Conclusion

SevaSetu is not a booking platform.

It is a **foundational trust layer** that allows India’s informal care economy to function safely at scale by replacing documents with verified capability.

By converting human conversation into verifiable credibility, the system enables safe hiring where formal certification is absent.
